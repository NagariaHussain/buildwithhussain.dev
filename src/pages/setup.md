### Personal Computer

I use the Apple MacBook Pro 16" (32GB RAM, M1 Pro) as my daily driver. All the streaming, editing, and coding is done on this beast.

**Keyboard: [Logitech K380 Wireless](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0779R9GB1)**

**Mouse: [Logitech Pebble Wireless Mouse](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0BFBDYRTP)**

### Software

1. [Open Broadcast Studio (OBS)](https://obsproject.com/welcome): for live streaming. It is nicely integrated with YouTube so you could just connect you account and start streaming an scheduled stream. You can even schedule a stream and access the live chat from right inside OBS!

2. [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/): Everything through the command bar! My most used keyboard shortcut is `CMD + T` to open the command bar!

3. [VS Code](https://vscode.dev/): Code Editor of Choice. Always. The magical autocomplete you see on the streams is [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

4. [DaVinci Resolve (FREE)](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) for all the motion graphics (intro video) and video editing needs.

### Streaming Hardware

1. [Blue Yeti Microphone](https://www.amazon.in/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Midnight/dp/B01LY6Z2M6) directly plugged into my MacBook with [Tonor Microphone Arm Stand](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B082W4B7SX)

1. [Wacom Intuos CTL-6100/K0-CX](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07BFH82V7) for that doodling and diagraming!

1. [This](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B09TXNQGKX) Green Screen, so you don't see what's happening on my background ðŸ˜‰

1. [GiftMaxÂ® Photography LED Video Soft Light Panel](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0B31Y4LB1) for lighting.
