### Personal Computer

I use the Apple MacBook Pro 16" (32GB RAM, M1 Pro) as my daily driver. All the streaming, editing, and coding is done on this beast.

**Keyboard: [Logitech K380 Wireless](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0779R9GB1)**

**Mouse: [Logitech Pebble Wireless Mouse](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0BFBDYRTP)**

### Software

1. [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/): Replaced my MacOS spotlight with this super powerful command palette. This is also where the confetti (ðŸŽ‰) comes from! I have assigned a keyboard shortcut to the confetti animation.

2. [VS Code](https://vscode.dev/): Code Editor of Choice. Always. The magical autocomplete you see on the streams is [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

3. [Open Broadcast Studio (OBS)](https://obsproject.com/welcome): for live streaming. It is nicely integrated with YouTube so you could just connect you account and start streaming an scheduled stream. You can even schedule a stream and access the live chat from right inside OBS!

    I have setup scenes for a lot of scenarios like screen share with guest, talking Hussain etc. and I just have to click to switch to a scenes (basically a setup of audio and video sources):

    OBS interface is fairly simple and does not need much learning.

1. [vdo.ninja](https://vdo.ninja): Used to stream guest and guest screen, makes it a breeze!

1. [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/): Everything through the command bar! My most used keyboard shortcut is `CMD + T` to open the command bar!

1. [DaVinci Resolve (FREE)](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) for all the motion graphics (intro video) and video editing needs.

1. [Screen Studio](https://screen.studio): For those sleek demo videos with automatic zoom/pan and mouse following!

1. [Figma](https://figma.com): For all the design needs including thumbnails, product design and more.

### Streaming Hardware

1. [Blue Yeti Microphone](https://www.amazon.in/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Midnight/dp/B01LY6Z2M6) directly plugged into my MacBook with [Tonor Microphone Arm Stand](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B082W4B7SX)

1. [Wacom Intuos CTL-6100/K0-CX](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07BFH82V7) for that doodling and diagraming!
