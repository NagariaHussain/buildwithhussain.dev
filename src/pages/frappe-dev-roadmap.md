## Frappe Developer Roadmap

Build your way to become a kick-ass Frappe Developer.

### Who is a Frappe Developer?

In my terms, *a good Frappe Developer is a good Web Developer* who has knowledge of, and works with Frappe Framework.

### 1. Start / Programming

Even if you have taken some kind of introduction to programming course or material, I highly recommend [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science)!

Professor David is just awesome! The main takeaway from this course is not knowledge of a particular programming language or stack, but computational thinking and problem solving.

### 2. Web Development

This is the first course that I took on Web Development:

* [Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp)

Colt is an inspiration. In this course, you will work with NodeJS, but the principles learnt are applicable to any modern tech stack for building web apps.

#### Projects

By the end of this course, you will have build your first full-stack CRUD web app!

### 4. Web Development with Python

After you have some practice building simple CRUD web apps, you can delve more into Python and using Python to build web applications.

#### Projects

1. Flask/FastAPI + Postgres Project

    I would personally suggest to build an app using Flask/FastAPI and Postgres from start to end! This app should also have authentication.

2. Django + MariaDB + Redis

    Working with Django will give you a taste of Framework. Delve a bit into Django's ORM, templating system and MVC architecture. Also, connect Redis for simple caching.

### 3. Frappe Framework

You can start by completing the [App Development with Frappe Framework Course](https://frappe.school/lms/courses/app-development-with-frappe-framework) on Frappe School.

Then build!
